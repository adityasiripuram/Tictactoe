Here, I have used Javascript, Html and css for building this Basic Tic-tac-toe game.

About game:

2 players X & O, by default, when any square is clicked X is marked and then player O and so on. This is human vs human, which can be played by 2 person or single person. The result is displaying after if the match draw and if the match won by any of the player, the winner is displayed in the alert .
